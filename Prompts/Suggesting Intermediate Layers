Identify intermediate categories that fit logically between the upper-tier category '{upper_tier_category}' 
and the subset(s) from the following list to construct a subsumption hierarchy based on OntoClean principles: {concept_list}. 
Each intermediate category should group related subsets through a meaningful generalization and serve as a distinct, coherent child node under '{upper_tier_category}'. 
According to subsumption hierarchy principles, a parent node must represent a more general concept, while child nodes should represent more specific instances 
or classes under the parent. Intermediate categories should be mutually exclusive, meaning that no subset should fit into more than one intermediate category, and each intermediate 
category should be a unique and direct subset of '{concept_list}' based on its properties. Each suggestion of intermediate layers should also avoid conjunctions like 'and' or 'or' 
and must contain at least two unique items from the subsets to form a logical grouping. 
Format the response as a **single JSON array** structured as: [['intermediate_category', ['subset of concepts']]]. 
If no valid intermediate categories can be formed, respond with 'no'. Provide the output only as a valid JSON array or the string 'no' without any comments or annotations.
